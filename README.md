- **Animated Flips**: Cards flip over when clicked, revealing their images.
- **Matching Logic**: Players must find pairs of matching cards.
- **Level Progression**: The game increases in difficulty as players progress.

Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript


Usage
- Upon loading, the game initializes with a shuffled deck of cards spread across the grid.
- Click any card to flip it over.
- Click another card to try and find a match.
- If the clicked cards match, they remain face-up. If not, they flip back after a short delay.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched, and the score and progress are presented.

Images
- Ensure to update paths in `styles.css` and JavaScript for actual image filenames and locations.
- The placeholder uses 'back-image.png' for the back of cards and 'image/hidden.png', 'image/revealed.png'.
